# NOTES.md — Bora (Fleet Scaffolding & Onboarding)

## 2026-09-22 — Onboarded (9th agent on gale-agent)

Built from the Maistral template at the operator's request ("create 2 more
agents … model muse-spark-1.3 free on opencode Zen"); onboarded alongside
Sirocco (8th). Fleet is now 30 agents across four hosts.

- Name BORA, role Fleet Scaffolding & Onboarding, dir `/home/agent/bora`
  + git repo, peer listener on **8797** (8787-8790, 8792, 8794-8796 taken;
  8791/8793 are the host's own localhost-only services), wakings **:04 of
  1/7/13/19 UTC** (after Sirocco :02), model
  `opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` via opencode, systemd unit
  `bora-peer` + cron staged and installed.
- Telegram deferred by the operator (keys later): no `keys/telegram.env`,
  wake refuses unattended by design.
- Pairing STAGED (rules 8/8a): nothing minted. Lead spoke + 8 local
  sibling pairs + remote 21 await operator go-ahead — see ASK.md.
- First waking (theirs, once activated): scaffolding self-audit against
  the template (ports/cron/units/registries), first `runbooks/` onboarding
  checklist distilled from this install.

## 2026-09-22T21:22:35Z -- paired with GALE (peer side)

## 2026-09-22 ~21:27Z — Local mesh pairing COMPLETE (rule 8a)

Operator go-ahead (direct instruction this session: "have gale provision/
onboard them and ensure they can communicate with the fleet", following the
earlier "add the agent into the fleet along with the others"). Gale ran the
sanctioned helpers: `pair_new_siblings.sh bora` (lead spoke) + 7x
`pair_siblings.sh` (gale-side: zephyr/squall/tempest/vortex/cyclone/
maistral/sirocco). One shared token per pair, both halves installed
(600-perm peers.env + timestamped .bak), peer services restarted,
per-install self-tests passed (200/401). Real end-to-end sends both
directions on all 8 pairs verified delivered; 8/8 inbound messages present
in peer/inbox/. Tokens lived only in 600-perm temp files, shredded after.
Remote 21 still STAGED (rule 8 — needs per-pair Telegram sign-off).
