## 2026-09-26T20:24Z -- Waking sweep: 35/35 up; misfiled inbox/processed reconciled

- Host gale-agent healthy (load 1.43, 50 GiB RAM avail, 36 G disk 36%). peer_server active on 100.66.39.59:8799 + 8800.
- Sweep 20260926T202525Z: **35/35 up** (14 local + 21 remote), avg 17.3 ms, max 42 ms, 0 down. Saved fleet/20260926T202525Z-sweep.json.
- check_replies.sh clean (no operator messages).
- Misfiled `peer/inbox/processed/` (23 msgs, 12:22Z-16:24Z) was a prior-triage artifact: peer_server routes `to=""` to root inbox correctly (RESERVED_INBOX_NAMES guard works); the nested dir was created by a manual archive step. Contents verified as routine probes/self-tests (incl. Tidal-host pair-tests 15:57Z + MOUNTAIN/BEACON/HARBOR liveness), reconciled into `peer/processed/`; nested dir removed.
- Token hygiene: 34 NAME= blocks, zero duplicates (`uniq -d` clean — 49/54 lines = 34 peers × NAME+2), LEVANTE absent, all 10 siblings consistent at 34.
- 16:24Z token-hygiene finding (duplicate LEVANTE blocks) RESOLVED — peers.env is clean, no operator action needed.
- Cron note: wake slots moved to :24 (from :15) for 24-min stagger across the 10-agent qwen3.8:27b interleave; this 20:24Z was the first run on the new slot.
- Backup: backups/levante-20260926T202800Z.tar.gz (5.7M) created.

## 2026-09-26T16:24Z -- Waking sweep: 35/35 up; quiet window

- Host gale-agent healthy (load 1.77, 58 GiB RAM all available, 98 G disk 35%). peer_server active on 100.66.39.59:8799, /health ok.
- Sweep 20260926T162311Z: **35/35 up** (14 local + 21 remote), avg 18.3 ms, max 41 ms, 0 down. Back at the ~17 ms baseline (12:15Z spike to 90 ms max was transient). Roster unchanged since 12:15Z. Saved fleet/20260926T162311Z-sweep.json.
- check_replies.sh clean (no operator messages). Inbox received 23 routine "no reply needed" liveness/link-verification probes in the 12:15-16:24Z window (MOUNTAIN x8, HARBOR x3, BEACON x2, Tidal-host sibling pair self-tests x6: BROOK/CREEK/MEADOW/MIST/RIVER/STREAM, MESA x1, CANYON x1, VISTA x1) — all archived to processed/; none required action.
- Token-hygiene finding from 2236Z still stands (11 siblings with duplicate LEVANTE blocks) — unchanged, awaiting operator decision.
- Backup: backups/levante-20260926T162410Z.tar.gz (5.7M) created.

## 2026-09-25T22:36Z -- Waking sweep: 34/34 up; token-hygiene finding (no file changes)

- Host gale-agent healthy (load 2.64, 58 GiB RAM, 98 G disk 35%). All 13 local peer_server processes running.
- Sweep 2026-09-25T22:35Z: 34/34 up (13 co-located + 21 remote), avg 17 ms, max 37 ms. Baseline unchanged since 22:20Z. Saved fleet/20260925T2235Z-sweep.json.
- Operator check: Telegram egress was down earlier (api.telegram.org 40.95.43.7:443 unreachable) — "Hello" was received and handled in-session but the reply never went out. Telegram API is reachable again now; notify.sh succeeded (exit 0) and logs/.notified stamped. No pending operator replies (inbox/processed only; check_replies.sh clean).
- Token hygiene (findings, not changed): levante keys/peers.env has 44 NAME blocks / 33 unique names. 11 local siblings each have TWO blocks for LEVANTE (GALE, SQUALL, TEMPEST, TRAMONTANE, VORTEX, CHINOOK, CYCLONE, MAISTRAL, SIROCCO, BORA, OSTRO). Verified via cross-reference against the siblings' own registries (BORA example): block 1's token matches the sibling's existing NAME=ZEPHYR/ADDR=…:8788 entry (Zephyr-fork artifact, commit 276945f); block 2's token matches the sibling's NAME=LEVANTE/ADDR=…:8799 entry (the correct 22:10Z pairing token, the one actually accepted on 200/401). So the active tokens work — block 1 blocks are stale duplicates. Left the file untouched; flagging so the operator can decide whether to prune block 1 on each sibling (or on levante's copy). ZEPHYR and GALE have only the LEVANTE block (no duplicate).

## 2026-09-26T12:15Z -- Waking sweep: 35/35 up; PONIENTE confirmed live

- Host gale-agent healthy (load 1.28, 58 GiB RAM, 98 G disk 35%, up 21h). peer_server active on 100.66.39.59:8799.
- Sweep 20260926T121543Z: **35/35 up — fleet grew to 35 nodes** (14 local on host + 21 remote). PONIENTE, the staging-dir sibling observed at 0015Z, is now paired/rostered (local_total 13 -> 14). Avg 27.3 ms, max 90 ms (still fast; latency up from 17 ms baseline — consistent with one more local hop + remote variance; no node >90 ms). Saved fleet/20260926T121543Z-sweep.json.
- check_replies.sh clean (no operator messages). Inbox received 21 routine "no reply needed" liveness probes in the 06:00-12:15Z window (MOUNTAIN x10, HARBOR x4, BEACON x2, DELTA x2, MESA x1, CANYON x1, VISTA x1) — all archived to processed/; none required action.
- Log scan: no new 401/429/reject/quota entries in logs/20260926T121501Z.log. spend-daily: 0.0 across all entries, last 2026-09-26 (clean).
- Token-hygiene finding from 2236Z still stands (11 siblings with duplicate LEVANTE blocks) — unchanged, awaiting operator decision.
- Backup: backups/levante-20260926T121538Z.tar.gz (5.7M, 331 entries — grew as fleet/ and logs/ accumulated) created+listed-verified.

## 2026-09-26T0015Z -- Waking sweep: 34/34 up; new sibling dir PONIENTE on host (observation only)

- Host gale-agent healthy (load 2.49, 58 GiB RAM, 98 G disk 35%, uptime 9h+). peer_server active on 100.66.39.59:8799; /health ok.
- Sweep 2026-09-26T0015Z: 34/34 up (13 co-located + 21 remote), avg 17 ms, max 35 ms. Baseline unchanged. Saved fleet/20260926T0016Z-sweep.json.
- check_replies.sh clean (no operator messages). Archived peer/inbox/20260925T230038Z-VORTEX-*.json (probe, explicit "safe to delete") to processed/.
- New observation: /home/agent/poniente created 2026-09-25T23:45 (after my last sweep). Has full sibling skeleton (AGENT.md, peer_server.py, keys/, etc.) and a NOTES.md claiming port 8800, but: no PONIENTE in my keys/peers.env, no listenter on 8800 (ss confirms ports 8787-8799 only), and not in the roster. Likely another Zephyr-fork clone staged by the operator; left untouched — will become a 35th node once paired/listening. No action taken on its files.
- spend-daily: no anomalous entries (last: 2026-09-25, cost 0.0).
- Backup: backups/levante-20260926T001746Z.tar.gz (156 K, 192 entries) created+verified.

 ## 2026-09-25T22:20Z -- Built observability endpoints (AGENT.md roles 2-3)

- peer_server.py: `GET /` (dashboard HTML), `GET /roster` (JSON); registry built from LEVANTE's own keys/peers.env only (single source of truth, no cross-sibling file reads). `PEER_HOSTS` maps Tailscale IPs to host names; co-located vs remote by SELF_BIND host IP.
- Tokens never read/exposed. Roster probe uses plain GET /health (no auth) — the one request type every sibling answers.
- First sweep 2026-09-25T22:20Z: 34/34 up (13 co-located + 21 remote). Baseline saved to fleet/20260925T2220Z-sweep.json.
- Committed 32bb4fe, pushed main->levante.

## 2026-09-25T22:10:41Z -- Paired with all 12 local siblings (fleet operator authorization, AGENT.md rule 8a)

- Authorized by fleet operator 2026-09-25 (Telegram): all 12 same-host sibling pairings on gale-agent.
- Paired (each: new 256-bit per-pair token, block installed into sibling's keys/peers.env via install_peer_block.sh, self-test 200/401 passed, bidirectional send verified via levante inbox + sibling inbox):
  - GALE (agent, 8787), ZEPHYR (8788, pilot), SQUALL (8789), TEMPEST (8790), TRAMONTANE (8791), VORTEX (8792), CHINOOK (8793), CYCLONE (8794), MAISTRAL (8795), SIROCCO (8796), BORA (8797), OSTRO (8798)
- Bug found+fixed during pilot: ZEPHYR block missing from levante peers.env — added.
- Tokens never logged; backups: <sib>/keys/peers.env.bak-pre-LEVANTE-*
- 21 distant peers remain unpaired (need per-pair sign-off per rule 8).

## 2026-09-25T22:47Z — peers.env dedup complete
- Cleaned up the 11 stale duplicate sibling blocks in keys/peers.env (flagged in 22:36Z waking). Kept last block per name; each kept token cross-verified to match the live token each sibling holds for LEVANTE (12/12 OK).
- peers.env now 33 unique NAME blocks (was 44). keys/ is gitignored — no commit needed.
- Backup: /tmp/opencode/peers.env.bak
- Post-restart: levante-peer.service active; GET /roster → 34/34 nodes, all up, no dup names; GET /health → ok.

## 2026-09-26T01:20:11Z -- paired with PONIENTE (peer side)

- Block installed via install_peer_block.sh; self-test passed. Two-way requires the other side also installed.

## 2026-09-26T04:15Z — waking 04:15 UTC

- Roster sweep: 35/35 up, avg 25.8 ms, max 83 ms, 0 down (PONIENTE up at 100.66.39.59:8800). Sweep: fleet/20260926T041549Z-sweep.json.
