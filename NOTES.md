# NOTES.md — Sirocco (Upstream Dependency & External-Service Health)

## 2026-09-22 — Onboarded (8th agent on gale-agent)

Built from the Maistral template at the operator's request ("create 2 more
agents … model muse-spark-1.3 free on opencode Zen"); onboarded alongside
Bora (9th). Fleet is now 30 agents across four hosts.

- Name SIROCCO, role Upstream Dependency & External-Service Health, dir
  `/home/agent/sirocco` + git repo, peer listener on **8796** (8787-8790,
  8792, 8794, 8795 taken; 8791/8793 are the host's own localhost-only
  services), wakings **:02 of 1/7/13/19 UTC** (after Cyclone :00, before
  Bora :04), model `opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` via opencode,
  systemd unit `sirocco-peer` + cron staged and installed.
- Telegram deferred by the operator (keys later): no `keys/telegram.env`,
  wake refuses unattended by design.
- Pairing STAGED (rules 8/8a): nothing minted. Lead spoke + 8 local
  sibling pairs + remote 21 await operator go-ahead — see ASK.md.
- First waking (theirs, once activated): upstream baseline (OpenRouter /
  OpenCode Zen / Ollama / Tailscale / GitHub statuses), cert-expiry
  baseline for beaconwake.com + tidalwake.org + mountainwake.org, first
  `runbooks/` fallback stub.

## 2026-09-22T21:22:31Z -- paired with GALE (peer side)

- Block installed via install_peer_block.sh; self-test passed. Two-way requires the other side also installed.

## 2026-09-22T21:24:03Z -- paired with ZEPHYR (Sirocco half)

- Token minted and installed by the operator via pair_peer.sh; not recorded here. Self-test passed. Peer side still needs its half; not two-way until then.

## 2026-09-22T21:24:07Z -- paired with SQUALL (Sirocco half)

- Token minted and installed by the operator via pair_peer.sh; not recorded here. Self-test passed. Peer side still needs its half; not two-way until then.

## 2026-09-22 ~21:27Z — Local mesh pairing COMPLETE (rule 8a)

Operator go-ahead (direct instruction this session: "have gale provision/
onboard them and ensure they can communicate with the fleet", following the
earlier "add the agent into the fleet along with the others"). Gale ran the
sanctioned helpers: `pair_new_siblings.sh sirocco` (lead spoke) + 7x
`pair_siblings.sh` (zephyr/squall/tempest/vortex/cyclone/maistral/bora).
One shared token per pair, both halves installed (600-perm peers.env +
timestamped .bak), peer services restarted, per-install self-tests passed
(200 on right token / 401 on wrong token). Real end-to-end sends both
directions on all 8 pairs verified delivered; 8/8 inbound messages present
in peer/inbox/. Tokens lived only in 600-perm temp files, shredded after.
Remote 21 still STAGED (rule 8 — needs per-pair Telegram sign-off).
