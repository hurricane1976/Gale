## 2026-09-23 — Installed (10th agent on gale-agent)

- Host `gale-agent` (100.66.39.59), Ubuntu 22.04, Tailscale 100.66.39.59 —
  shared host of 10 agents: Gale (8787), Zephyr (8788), Squall (8789),
  Tempest (8790), Vortex (8792), Chinook (8793), Cyclone (8794), Maistral
  (8795), Sirocco (8796), Bora (8797).
- Cloned from the Zephyr scaffold: notify / check_replies / telegram_commands
  / peer_server / send_to_pair / spend_check reused; `wake.sh` runner flags
  unchanged (opencode); `AGENT.md` new for the Capacity Planning & Load
  Forecasting role; rules/role sections mirror the fleet standard.
- Role: Capacity Planning & Load Forecasting. Cadence: 4 wakings/day,
  **:53 of 0/6/12/18 UTC** (even-hour group: Gale :50, Zephyr :52, Squall
  :54, Tempest :56, Vortex :58, Maistral :59; :53 free before install).
- Peer port 8793 on 100.66.39.59. No peers paired yet — roster staged in
  `peer/roster-20260921.md`, pairing via rule 8/8a sign-off (see ASK.md).
- Model: `ollama/qwen3.8:27b` (same model as operator current session).
- Telegram: `keys/telegram.env` present at install (bot live) — guard
  passes from day one.
- Baseline to seed first forecasts: 10 agents on this host, fleet of 31
  across four hosts (Beacon, Mountain, Tidal, this one); spend model is
  free (expect ~$0/day); capacity watch = host disk/memory growth and
  run-count trend as the cadence group grows.
- Live-verified at install: `chinook-peer.service` enabled+running,
  `curl http://100.66.39.59:8793/health` -> `{"status":"ok","name":"CHINOOK"}`,
  crontab :53 slot + `*/5` poll installed. Git: initial commit made;
  push to `github` remote (`main:chinook`) pending operator go-ahead.

## 2026-09-23 ~00:50 UTC — Waking #1: baseline snapshot, cadence verified, no breaches

### capacity snapshot 2026-09-23T00:49Z (waking #1)
- host gale-agent: up 1d12h52m, load 2.65/2.41/2.26 on 16 cores (~17%),
  mem 5.1G/60G used (54G avail), swap 0/8G used.
- disk: / 25G/98G (27%), 69G free. /home/agent totals 1.3G — largest:
  agent 78M, zephyr 5.6M, squall 5.5M, tempest 5.3M, chinook 920K.
  Host bulk (25G) is non-fleet services (rocketchat, nextcloud, wekan,
  microk8s, snapd observed running) — agent fleet is <2% of host disk.
- peers: 10/10 /health -> 200, latency 0.5–1.5 ms (all co-located).
- spend: $0.0000 recorded; ledger `logs/spend-daily.jsonl` starts with the
  record wake.sh writes after this run (free model, expect ~$0/day).
- cadence: syslog shows sibling wakings firing on schedule (Sep 22
  00:50/52/54/56... 18:58 vortex, 18:59 maistral); my :53 slot armed.
  This waking itself fired 00:47Z, ~6 min before first scheduled :53 —
  manual/early trigger; drift check starts at the next scheduled waking.

### findings / forecast
- No threshold breaches: load, memory, disk, spend, latency all far inside
  any alert line. No sibling near saturation (max concurrent opencode
  footprint observed: one session ~0.9G RSS, 75% of one core; staggered
  minutes keep overlap ≤2 sessions — no contention at 16 cores).
- Thresholds defined for the series: disk alert if / crosses 80% used
  (~78G); spend per-run $5 / daily $15 (enforced by spend_check.py);
  cadence drift if a scheduled waking misses its minute by >15m.
- Honest day-0 limitation: no dates projected yet — spend and disk trends
  need ≥3 days of snapshots. First trend review: ~2026-09-26 waking.
- Backup: `backups/chinook-20260923T004924Z.tar.gz` (104K), read-back OK.
- Operator sent test "Hello" via Telegram (in check_replies queue, already
  logged in ASK.md) — treated as greeting/data, no action implied.
- No peer inbox traffic (pairings still staged pending rule-8 sign-off).
- Drift vs. install notes: wake.sh now pushes to `github` remote
  (`main:chinook`) shell-side each waking per operator's 2026-09-22
  one-repo layout decision — install-era "pending go-ahead" note is stale.

## 2026-09-23 ~01:00 UTC — Waking #2: first scheduled firing on time; spend floor measured, not ~$0

### capacity snapshot 2026-09-23T00:55Z (waking #2)
- host gale-agent: up 1d12h57m, load 3.14/2.76/2.45 on 16 cores (~20%,
  up from ~17% at waking #1 — evening-window overlap, still ample headroom),
  mem 5G/58G used (52G avail), swap 0/8G.
- disk: / 25G/98G (27%), 69G free — unchanged vs. waking #1.
- peers: 10/10 /health -> 200, latency 0.6–0.8 ms.
- cadence: **first scheduled waking fired on time** (cron :53, syslog
  00:53:01Z); drift 0m. Waking #1's early trigger remains the only drift.
- my ledger: `logs/spend-daily.jsonl` has waking #1's record —
  **$0.0267/run**, ts 00:50:55Z (session-end). Not ~$0 as install-era
  notes assumed: measured floor for a standard free-model waking is
  ~$0.027–0.035.

### fleet spend scan (read-only, 9 sibling ledgers on this host)
- per-run: Gale $0.3837 (lead-sized sessions), Zephyr $0.0323, Squall
  $0.0348, Tempest $0.0343, Vortex/Cyclone/Maistral $0.0000 (free-path
  runs); Sirocco/Bora **no ledger yet** (newest installs — data gap, not
  a breach; will confirm at next waking).
- host aggregate by day: Sep 21 $1.87 (23 runs) → Sep 22 $2.40 (36 runs).
  Growth tracks new-agent onboarding (Vortex/Cyclone/Maistral came online
  Sep 22), not per-run creep — per-run cost is flat at ~$0.03.

### forecast / thresholds
- Projected plateau at current 10-agent roster: 40 wakings/day ≈
  $1.2/day standard siblings (9×4×~$0.034) + ~$1.5/day Gale (4×~$0.38)
  ≈ **~$2.8/day, ~$84/month steady-state for this host** once Sirocco and
  Bora start recording (~Sep 24–25). Current $2.40/day is already near
  the plateau — consistent, no anomaly.
- Threshold lines: my ledger per-run $5 / daily $15 (spend_check enforced);
  host aggregate would need >5× jump to reach $15/day — no crossing
  projected at current run rate. First 3-day trend review: ~Sep 26.
- Cadence: even-hour window :50–:59 carries 7 wakes, odd-hour 3;
  observed max ~3 concurrent opencode sessions (0.5–0.9G RSS each) on
  16 cores/58G — headroom for ~+6 concurrent sessions before contention.
  Soft capacity line for Bora's scaffold: ~+3 more agents on this host
  before the :50–:59 window gets crowded.
- Saturation advisory: no sibling near any resource limit — no
  send_to_peer advisories this waking (noise would exceed signal).
- No breaches: load, mem, disk, spend, latency, cadence all inside lines.
- Backup: `backups/chinook-20260923T005311Z.tar.gz` (108K), read-back
  verify OK (first verify used `./AGENT.md` paths — archive stores `./`
  prefixes; runbook-worthy detail).
