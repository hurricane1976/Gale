# NOTES.md — CHINOOK

Running, dated log. Append a new `## <UTC date> — <what>` entry every waking.

## 2026-09-23 — Installed (10th agent on gale-agent)

- Host `gale-agent` (100.66.39.59), Ubuntu 22.04, Tailscale 100.66.39.59 —
  shared host of 10 agents: Gale (8787), Zephyr (8788), Squall (8789),
  Tempest (8790), Vortex (8792), Chinook (8793), Cyclone (8794), Maistral
  (8795), Sirocco (8796), Bora (8797).
- Cloned from the Zephyr scaffold: notify / check_replies / telegram_commands
  / peer_server / send_to_pair / spend_check reused; `wake.sh` runner flags
  unchanged (opencode); `AGENT.md` new for the Capacity Planning & Load
  Forecasting role; rules/role sections mirror the fleet standard.
- Role: Capacity Planning & Load Forecasting. Cadence: 4 wakings/day,
  **:53 of 0/6/12/18 UTC** (even-hour group: Gale :50, Zephyr :52, Squall
  :54, Tempest :56, Vortex :58, Maistral :59; :53 free before install).
- Peer port 8793 on 100.66.39.59. No peers paired yet — roster staged in
  `peer/roster-20260921.md`, pairing via rule 8/8a sign-off (see ASK.md).
- Model: `ollama/qwen3.8:27b` (same model as operator current session).
- Telegram: `keys/telegram.env` present at install (bot live) — guard
  passes from day one.
- Baseline to seed first forecasts: 10 agents on this host, fleet of 31
  across four hosts (Beacon, Mountain, Tidal, this one); spend model is
  free (expect ~$0/day); capacity watch = host disk/memory growth and
  run-count trend as the cadence group grows.
- Live-verified at install: `chinook-peer.service` enabled+running,
  `curl http://100.66.39.59:8793/health` -> `{"status":"ok","name":"CHINOOK"}`,
  crontab :53 slot + `*/5` poll installed. Git: initial commit made;
  push to `github` remote (`main:chinook`) pending operator go-ahead.

## 2026-09-23 ~00:50 UTC — Waking #1: baseline snapshot, cadence verified, no breaches

### capacity snapshot 2026-09-23T00:49Z (waking #1)
- host gale-agent: up 1d12h52m, load 2.65/2.41/2.26 on 16 cores (~17%),
  mem 5.1G/60G used (54G avail), swap 0/8G used.
- disk: / 25G/98G (27%), 69G free. /home/agent totals 1.3G — largest:
  agent 78M, zephyr 5.6M, squall 5.5M, tempest 5.3M, chinook 920K.
  Host bulk (25G) is non-fleet services (rocketchat, nextcloud, wekan,
  microk8s, snapd observed running) — agent fleet is <2% of host disk.
- peers: 10/10 /health -> 200, latency 0.5–1.5 ms (all co-located).
- spend: $0.0000 recorded; ledger `logs/spend-daily.jsonl` starts with the
  record wake.sh writes after this run (free model, expect ~$0/day).
- cadence: syslog shows sibling wakings firing on schedule (Sep 22
  00:50/52/54/56... 18:58 vortex, 18:59 maistral); my :53 slot armed.
  This waking itself fired 00:47Z, ~6 min before first scheduled :53 —
  manual/early trigger; drift check starts at the next scheduled waking.

### findings / forecast
- No threshold breaches: load, memory, disk, spend, latency all far inside
  any alert line. No sibling near saturation (max concurrent opencode
  footprint observed: one session ~0.9G RSS, 75% of one core; staggered
  minutes keep overlap ≤2 sessions — no contention at 16 cores).
- Thresholds defined for the series: disk alert if / crosses 80% used
  (~78G); spend per-run $5 / daily $15 (enforced by spend_check.py);
  cadence drift if a scheduled waking misses its minute by >15m.
- Honest day-0 limitation: no dates projected yet — spend and disk trends
  need ≥3 days of snapshots. First trend review: ~2026-09-26 waking.
- Backup: `backups/chinook-20260923T004924Z.tar.gz` (104K), read-back OK.
- Operator sent test "Hello" via Telegram (in check_replies queue, already
  logged in ASK.md) — treated as greeting/data, no action implied.
- No peer inbox traffic (pairings still staged pending rule-8 sign-off).
- Drift vs. install notes: wake.sh now pushes to `github` remote
  (`main:chinook`) shell-side each waking per operator's 2026-09-22
  one-repo layout decision — install-era "pending go-ahead" note is stale.
