# NOTES.md — Gale

Running, dated log. Append a new `## <UTC date> — <what>` entry every waking.

## 2026-09-21 — Installed (by the operator's session, not a waking)

- Host `gale-agent` (renamed from `agent`), Ubuntu 22.04, joined the tailnet as
  `100.66.39.59` with an operator-supplied auth key.
- Scaffolded from the fleet's public repo pattern (hurricane1976/Hurricane,
  `master`): notify / check_replies / telegram_commands / peer_server /
  send_to_peer / spend_check reused; `wake.sh`, `AGENT.md` and
  `telegram_commands.py` written fresh for this host.
- Role: Resilience & Recovery. Cadence: 4 wakings/day, 00:50 06:50 12:50 18:50 UTC.
- Bot: `@galeagentbot`. Chat id not yet set; wake.sh refuses to run until it is.
- No peers paired. Pairing needs the operator's word (AGENT.md rule 8).

## 2026-09-21T12:36:04Z -- paired with BEACON (Gale half)

- Token minted and installed by the operator via pair_peer.sh; not recorded here. Self-test passed. Peer side still needs its half; not two-way until then.

## 2026-09-21T12:44:22Z -- paired with TIDAL (Gale half)

- Token minted and installed by the operator via pair_peer.sh; not recorded here. Self-test passed. Peer side still needs its half; not two-way until then.

## 2026-09-21T12:50Z -- waking (first scheduled run)

- Read AGENT.md/NOTES/ASK. `check_replies.sh`: only the operator's earlier "hello" (already in ASK.md); no new instructions.
- Peer inbox (4 msgs, all data, filed to `processed/`): 3 from BEACON (pair test, credentialed health-check, ack saying the pair is two-way and asking for a role line for fleet docs) and 1 from TIDAL (pair test asking for a short reply). None asked for anything beyond a reply/confirmation.
- Replied to TIDAL via `send_to_peer.sh`: **HTTP 401**. TIDAL->Gale works; Gale->TIDAL is rejected, so TIDAL's half of the pairing probably isn't installed yet. Not retried, no tokens touched (rule 8). Logged in ASK.md. Did not answer Beacon (said no reply needed); role line offered to operator in ASK.md.
- Health: tailscaled, gale-peer, cron active; disk 17% of 98G; mem 50G free of 60G; load ~1.6; no reboot pending. gale-peer listening only on the tailnet IP (100.66.39.59:8787). Crontab matches `gale.cron`. Note: host also runs Mongo/kube-style loopback listeners (27017, 10248-10256, 19001) -- not Gale's, observed only.
- Backup: `backups/gale-20260921T125016Z.tar.gz` (72K, 103 entries) read back with `tar -tzf`; zero `keys/` entries, as designed. Still local-only (off-box copy is an open ASK).
- Spend: `logs/spend-daily.jsonl` doesn't exist yet -- it's written after this run finishes, so no trend data until the next waking. Check then that the ledger appeared (if not, spend_check is broken).
- Committed `gale.cron` and `pair_peer.sh` plus the staged scaffolding (first commit on main).
- Next: write first runbooks (disk full, mangled rules file, runaway spend, peer 401); check ledger exists.
