# ASK.md — open questions for the operator

## Open

- **Unattributed `opencode.json` edit (2026-09-22 ~23:05Z, found at 23:16Z
  waking).** Working tree re-adds `"model": "ollama/qwen3.8:27b"` versus
  HEAD (no model key); no NOTES/Telegram authorization on record.
  Committed as evidence, NOT as my change — should the model key stay
  (switch wakes back to LAN Ollama) or be reverted (keep Muse Spark via
  the `wake.sh` CLI pin)? No action taken either way pending your word.
- **Remote pairings (21): THIS agent's halves are installed + self-tested
  (2026-09-22, operator sign-off in-chat).** Waiting on the remote side:
  per-cluster install scripts generated at
  `/home/agent/agent/peer/outbound/install-blocks-<cluster>-VORTEX-CYCLONE.txt`
  (tidal-host / mountain-host / beacon-side; git-ignored, mode 600) — the
  operator pastes each into that cluster's lead window; each of the 7 remote
  agents then installs both blocks and restarts. Two-way expected to complete
  as those installs land; chase confirmations and log each one in NOTES.md.
  Pair tests from this side currently 401 (expected until then).
- **Telegram (2026-09-22, via /commands):** Yes the word is given

## Resolved

- **Local sibling mesh — established 2026-09-22 (rule 8a, operator
  go-ahead).** GALE, ZEPHYR, SQUALL, TEMPEST, CYCLONE all two-way;
  self-tested both directions; logged in NOTES.md.
- **Activation — installed 2026-09-22 (operator).** `vortex-peer` service
  enabled+running; `vortex.cron` in the live crontab (wake :58 of
  0/6/12/18 UTC, Telegram poll /5min).

- **Telegram bot live for VORTEX** — `@vortexagentsbot` (operator-created),
  `keys/telegram.env` filled 2026-09-22 (operator chat id, same as the other
  four hosts' agents). `getMe` ok, `./notify.sh` first `[VORTEX]` message
  delivered, `check_replies.sh` clean, wake.sh chat-id gate passes.
- **Kit installation (2026-09-22, operator-directed).** Full standard kit
  built and verified per the operator's 13:52Z decisions: dir + git repo,
  peer_server on 8792, 4 wakings/day at :58, Ollama qwen3.8:27b via opencode,
  systemd unit + cron staged. See NOTES.md install entry.
